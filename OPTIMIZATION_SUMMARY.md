## ðŸ›  Usage Examples

### High Performance (Speed Priority)
```go
writer := NewWriter(document)
writer.options = FastSaveOptions()  // No compression, maximum speed
```

### Balanced Performance (Default)
```go
writer := NewWriter(document)
// DefaultSaveOptions() is used automatically
```

### Maximum Compression (Size Priority)
```go
writer := NewWriter(document)
writer.options = CompactSaveOptions()  // Maximum compression
```

### Custom Configuration
```go
writer := NewWriter(document)
writer.options = SaveOptions{
    CompressionLevel:     flate.DefaultCompression,
    ConcurrentComponents: true,
    MinimalNumbering:     true,
    BufferSize:          32 * 1024,
}
```
